Rename an entire VS solution easily

Before renaming a solution, it's recommended to remove the following folders in all the projects :
- bin
- obj
- .vs
- package 

Move this console out of the solution to rename directory !

The console will ask for :
- the solution name to replace
- the solution root directory
- the desired solution name
